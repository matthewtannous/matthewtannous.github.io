A fun 2D game made with Python using the pygame library. In the game, the player controls a ball and must move left and right
(with the arrow keys), as well as jump (with the space key) to avoid incoming projectiles.
The player can leave the game at any time, and the highscore will be saved and displayed in the top-left section of the screen.
